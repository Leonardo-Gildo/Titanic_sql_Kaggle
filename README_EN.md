\# 🚢 Titanic SQL Kaggle - Study Project



This repository documents my learning journey in \*\*SQL Server, Docker, and Data Analysis\*\*, applied to the challenge \*\*\[Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)\*\*.



---



\## 📌 Project Goals

\- Strengthen fundamentals of \*\*SQL Server\*\* (SSMS and Azure Data Studio).  

\- Learn to use \*\*Docker\*\* as a database environment.  

\- Work with \*\*data import, cleaning, and transformation\*\*.  

\- Write \*\*SQL queries\*\* for data exploration.  

\- Submit predictions to Kaggle to understand the workflow of a data competition.  



---



\## 🛠️ Tech Stack

\- SQL Server 2022 (local and via Docker)  

\- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)  

\- Azure Data Studio (ADS)  

\- Git + GitHub for version control  

\- Kaggle (Titanic competition)

\## 📈 Learning Progress

1\. \*\*Environment setup\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Installed SQL Server on Windows.  

&nbsp;  - Created a Docker container with SQL Server 2022.  

&nbsp;  - Connected using SSMS and ADS.  



2\. \*\*Data Import\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Imported `train.csv`, `test.csv`, and `gender\_submission.csv`.  

&nbsp;  - Created \*\*staging\*\* and \*\*clean\*\* tables.  



3\. \*\*Data Exploration (SQL Queries)\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Simple queries (counts, averages, groupings).  

&nbsp;  - Practice exercises to consolidate SQL skills.  



4\. \*\*Kaggle Submission\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Generated `submission.csv` using SQL.  

&nbsp;  - Uploaded to Kaggle and validated first score.  



---



\## 🚀 Next Steps

\- Build more exploratory queries.  

\- Move into Python + Pandas to complement analysis.  

\- Explore Machine Learning techniques to improve Kaggle score.
